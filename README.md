# Interactive Raindrops

This is an interactive raindrop simulation implemented using p5.js library. It allows users to create raindrops and boxes, which interact with each other based on collision detection. The raindrops fall from the top of the canvas, and when they hit a box, the box starts tumbling and the raindrop gets highlighted.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the raindrop simulation [here](link-to-live-demo).

## Features

- Raindrops are created based on microphone input, allowing users to control the rain intensity with their voice.
- Boxes are created randomly on the canvas.
- Gyroscope events are supported to adjust raindrop positions based on device movement.
- Raindrops change color based on their velocity.
- Boxes are highlighted when hit by raindrops.
- Interactive mouse events:
  - Click to create new raindrops.
  - Click and drag to create new boxes.

## Getting Started
